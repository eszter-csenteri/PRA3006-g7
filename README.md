# Group 7- Radiopharmaceuticals Explorer


## Exploring protein targets of radiopharmaceuticals.


This project, Radiopharmaceuticals Explorer, provides interactive visualizations for mapping the relationships between radiopharmaceuticals and their possible targets for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The aim was to understand the current landscape of possible molecular targets for radiopharmaceuticals used in imaging and targeted therapies. By using the non-radioactive version of the isotopes from ChEMBL, binding affinity and target selectivity was retrieved and calculated. The project can assist researchers and clinicians in understanding how radiopharmaceuticals interact with the human proteome, and possibly guide direction in future drug development.
