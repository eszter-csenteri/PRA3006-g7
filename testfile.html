<p>Radiopharmaceuticals for targeting amyloid aggregates are primarily used in positron emission tomography (PET) scans to diagnose conditions like Alzheimer's disease. 
            Approved examples include florbetapir F18 (Amyvid™), florbetaben F18 (Neuraceq™), and flutemetamol F18 (Vizamyl™), which are designed to bind to amyloid plaques in the brain.
